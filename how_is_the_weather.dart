"Ugh, It's been so hot out lately, why does it have to be  degreesâ€¦"
" degrees? That's freezing!"

You're had quite enough of confusing conversations with Americans who assume 
you're using Fahrenheit when Celsius is clearly the way to go. 
Rather than argue with them, you've settled for writing a program to 
conveniently convert temperatures measured in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit 
instead.

You came across the following formula, which holds true given that  is a 
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit while  is that same temperature in degrees 
Celsius:

C = (5/9) * (F - 32)

F = ((9 * C)/5) + 32
Given a value of C, which is an integer, determine the corresponding value of F, 
so that you can express the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for the 
Americans' benefit.

It's guaranteed that C will be chosen such that will come out to exactly an 
integer, but you may output it with 0 or more digits after the decimal point.

Input Specification

The first and only line of input consists of a single integer C.

Output Specification

Output a single integer, the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit which is 
equivalent to degrees Celsius.

Sample Input

20

Sample Output

68
