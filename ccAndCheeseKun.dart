/*
One summer evening, while curled up with her beloved Cheese-kun plushie, C.C. 
begins craving pizza. 
Although she would really like a large, extra-cheesy pizza, her stomach is 
willing to settle for anything. Without hesitation, she snatches up Lelouch's 
credit card and makes a very important phone callâ€¦

C.C. will be absolutely satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 3 units 
and an extra-cheesiness of at least 95%.
C.C. will be fairly satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 1 unit and an 
extra-cheesiness of at most 50%.
C.C. will be very satisfied with any other pizza she receives.

Input Specification

The first line of input will contain a single integer between 1 and 3 denoting 
the width of the pizza C.C. receives.

The second line of input will contain another integer between 0 and 100 
representing the percentage of the pizza covered in extra cheese.

Output Specification

A single line containing C.C.'s satisfaction with her order in the form: 
C.C. is very satisfied with her pizza.


Sample Input

2
70

Sample Output

C.C. is very satisfied with her pizza.

Explanation

The pizza has a width of 2 units and a cheesiness of 70 %. Since C.C. is neither 
absolutely nor fairly satisfied, she is very satisfied.
